üí¨ Task 4 ‚Äì Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
üìò Overview

The objective of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on textual data such as reviews, comments, or social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The goal is to analyze and classify text into categories like positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
This task demonstrates practical knowledge of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training using supervised machine learning algorithms to derive insights from unstructured textual data.

üéØ Goals

Collect and preprocess textual data for analysis.

Apply NLP techniques to clean and prepare text (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal).

Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF or Bag of Words.

Train a sentiment classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix visualizations.

Generate insights to understand overall sentiment trends within the dataset.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Category	Tools / Libraries
Programming Language	Python 3
Libraries	Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
NLP Techniques	Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Stemming, TF-IDF Vectorization

üßÆ Workflow

Data Collection

Import a dataset containing text reviews or comments (e.g., product reviews, tweets, feedback).

Data Preprocessing

Clean text by removing special characters, numbers, and punctuation.

Convert all text to lowercase.

Apply tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming using NLTK.

Feature Extraction

Use TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numeric form suitable for model input.

Model Training and Prediction

Split data into training and test sets.

Train a classification model (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes).

Predict sentiment labels for unseen text samples.

Model Evaluation

Evaluate model accuracy and precision.

Visualize results using confusion matrix and classification reports.

Insights Generation

Determine the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Identify frequently used words or phrases associated with each sentiment class.

üìä Example Use Cases

E-commerce: Analyze customer reviews to gauge product satisfaction.

Social Media: Detect overall public opinion about brands or events.

Movies & Entertainment: Analyze viewer feedback to understand audience engagement.

üßæ Deliverables

A Jupyter Notebook / Colab file containing:

Text cleaning and preprocessing.

Model training and testing.

Evaluation metrics and visualizations.

Example predictions on custom input.

A README summary explaining methodology, results, and key insights.

üí° Expected Outcome

By completing this task, you will:

Gain hands-on experience with NLP and text mining.

Understand how to convert unstructured text into analyzable data.

Learn to train and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment prediction.

Be able to interpret and present sentiment-based insights visually and analytically
